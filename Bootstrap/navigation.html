<h4>Basketball is a fast-paced sport played between two teams, each aiming to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop. 
    It requires teamwork, agility, and quick decision-making. Players dribble the ball, pass it to teammates, and attempt to outmaneuver defenders to make a basket. With its thrilling combination of offense and defense, basketball not only tests physical endurance but also sharpens strategic thinking.
     Whether it's a casual game in the park or a professional match, the excitement of basketball keeps players and fans engaged.</h4>
